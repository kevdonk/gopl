The Go Programming Language book 

TODO:
During section 11-4:

comparison in ex1-3

comparison in 2-3, 2-4, 2-5

(curiousity: compare performance of 2 approaches to ex3-12)

SKIPPED for now:
ex 3-5 to 3-9 which are on coloring fractals and building a web server to display them

the web server is nearly identical to ex3-4 and 1-12 and the fractal colorization problems aren't that interesting
